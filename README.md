soddi
=====

StackOverflow Data Dump Importer. Forked from https://bitbucket.org/bitpusher/soddi/ because abandonware is sad.

Using It
--------

- Create a folder to hold the extracted XML files (e.g. `C:\Users\jeremiah\Desktop\Export`)
- Extract files into a separate folder per StackExchange site (e.g. `072013 Android`). The MMYYYY format is important.
- Fire up the `soddi.exe`
- Select the extracted XML folder in the **Source** text box.
- Select the Sites you want to import
- Set up your connection string
- Adjust batch size as you see fit
- Click **Import**
- Depending on the size of the import, you may want to grab a sandwich
